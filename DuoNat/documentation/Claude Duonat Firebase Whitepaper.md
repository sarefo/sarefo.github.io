# DuoNat Whitepaper for Firebase migration

I'm currently migrating my code base to Firebase. Please guide me through the process, while making sure my code is clean, efficient and scales well.

At this point, I have a DuoNat-Firebase repo on github, and a new project on Firebase. The MongoDB data has been migrated to Firestore. There is no code in the new repo yet. The file 'firebase_file_tree.txt' shows the firebase file tree.

I migrated api.js, and we should keep porting stuff from old codebase to new. I have no idea about typescript, keep that in mind.

Let's focus on migrating the existing code first, while making sure it's clean so that authentication etc. can be added afterwards.
