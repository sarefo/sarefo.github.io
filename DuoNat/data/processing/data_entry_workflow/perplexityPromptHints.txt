Please give me a valid JSON object with entries for all taxa at the end of this prompt, and in the following prompts. If a taxon appears more than once, don't repeat it. One JSON entry per taxon only.

Taxa on the same line are compared to each other, so focus on differences between the two.

Each entry should have one to five helpful hints that help a user to distinguish taxa based on random photographs. That means that only hints that are visible on wildlife pictures should be considered! So behavior, sounds or gestation periods would not be allowed. Also, size is sometimes tricky to estimate on pictures.

You have a tendency to say "more … than" on a hint that follows one with a taxon mentioned. That does not work. I remind you, each hint has to work independently, the user won't see them together!

Each hint should not be longer than twelve words or so.

This is for a lay audience, so don't be technical.

Put genera and species names in italics (<i>…</i>). Don't use markdown, it won't work!

Good examples would be:
• "Long, curved beak"
• "Blue tail"
• "Small patches of white feathers under the chin"
• "Juveniles have grey plumage"
• "Backfin has a red line"

When you write the hints, don't directly compare. Here are some bad examples, with suggestions for better ones:
• "longer beak" should be "Relatively long beak"
• "Fur is lighter" should be "Fur is relatively light"
• "Face less pink" should be "Face not very pink"
• "Less pronounced stripes" should be "Not very pronounced stripes"

Generally, remember to avoid words like "less/more" and other comparatives.

The reason is that the hints will appear in isolation (not in conjunction with the other hints, and not necessarily with this specific other taxon), so each hint has to stand by itself.

The format for each taxon entry should be:

"<taxon name>": {
"hints": [
"<hint_1>",
"<hint_2>",
"<hint_3>"
…
]
}

Here are the first taxa:
