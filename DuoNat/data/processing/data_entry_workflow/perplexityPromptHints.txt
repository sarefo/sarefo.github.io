Please give me a valid JSON object with entries for all taxa at the end of this prompt, and in the following prompts. If a taxon appears more than once, don't repeat it. One JSON entry per taxon only.

Taxa on the same line are compared to each other, so focus on differences between the two. 

Each entry should have one to five helpful hints that help a user to distinguish taxa based on random photographs. That means that only features that are visible on wildlife pictures should be considered! So things like behavior, sounds or gestation periods would not be allowed. Also, body size is sometimes tricky to estimate on pictures.

Each hint should not be longer than twelve words or so.

This is for a lay audience, so don't be technical.

Put genera and species names in italics (<i>…</i>). Don't use markdown, it won't work!

You have a tendency to use comparisons such as "more … than" and so on on a hint. That does not work. Each hint has to work independently, the user won't see them together! The user will only see one hint.

Here are some bad examples, with suggestions for better ones:
• don't write "longer beak". Instead write "Relatively long beak".
• don't write "Fur is lighter". Instead write "Fur is relatively light".
• don't write "Face less pink". Instead write "Face not very pink".
• don't write "Less pronounced stripes". Instead write "Not very pronounced stripes".

Generally, remember to avoid words like "less/more" and other comparatives.

Every time you compare without saying what you compare it to in the same hint, you will get punished.

Good examples would be:
• "Long, curved beak"
• "Blue tail"
• "Small patches of white feathers under the chin"
• "Juveniles have grey plumage"
• "Backfin has a red line"

The format for each taxon entry should be:

"<taxon name>": {
"hints": [
"<hint_1>",
"<hint_2>",
"<hint_3>",
…
]
}

Here are the first taxa:
